    "Que 1: Name any five plots that we can plot using the Seaborn library. Also, state the uses of each plot.\n",

    "  Here are eight Seaborn plots and their uses in plain English:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Scatter Plot:** Like throwing darts at a board, shows how two things relate to each other. Dots closer together mean stronger connection.\n",
    "Useful for checking if one variable goes up when another does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Bar Plot:** Think of stacked candy bars, each bar shows how much of something belongs to a category. Great for comparing quantities \n",
    "across different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Histogram:** Imagine buckets collecting your data, shows how many fall in each range. Helpful for understanding data spread\n",
    "and if it's bunched up or spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Box Plot:** Like a fancy mustache, shows the middle half of your data, the spread, and outliers. Useful for quickly comparing groups and \n",
    "spotting unusual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Violin Plot:** Think of a squashed violin showing data density. Similar to box plots but also shows distribution shape. Good for comparing \n",
    "both center and spread across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Heatmap:** Like a colorful temperature map, shows how two things vary together. Darker areas mean more of something happening. Great for \n",
    "exploring relationships between many variables at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Pair Plot:** Think of a grid of scatter plots, shows how each pair of variables relates. Useful for seeing all pairwise relationships in your \n",
    "data in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Facet Grid:** Imagine splitting your data into smaller plots, then making the same plot for each group. Helps compare trends within different \n",
    "categories of your data.\n",

    "These are just eight examples, Seaborn has many more plots! Remember, the best plot depends on your data and what you want to learn from it.\n",
